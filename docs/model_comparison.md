## Primary Recommendation

Based on the project requirements and constraints, we recommend starting with a **Multi-label Decision Tree** approach, potentially enhanced with ensemble methods. Here's why:

1. **Data Considerations**
   - Limited initial dataset (Sri Lankan context)
   - Mix of numerical and categorical features
   - Need to handle missing data

2. **Technical Constraints**
   - Mobile deployment requirement
   - Need for quick inference
   - Resource limitations

3. **User Experience**
   - Requirement for explainable recommendations
   - Multiple career path suggestions
   - Easy to understand decision process

## Implementation Strategy

```python
# Recommended Implementation Approach
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# or from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

class CareerGuidanceModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = MultiOutputClassifier(
            DecisionTreeClassifier(
                max_depth=10,
                min_samples_split=5,
                min_samples_leaf=2
            )
        )
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Data Growth**
   - As dataset grows, consider transitioning to Gradient Boosting
   - Implement A/B testing for model comparison

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor mobile performance metrics
   - Implement model pruning if needed
   - Consider quantization for mobile deployment

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create domain-specific features for Sri Lankan education
   - Implement feature selection based on importance

## Evaluation Metrics
